# Hastalaya: Real-Time Bharatanatyam Mudra Recognition

## Project Overview
Hastalaya is a Computer Vision project developed to bridge the gap between traditional dance and technology. It identifies over 50 foundational Bharatanatyam mudras (hand gestures) using deep learning.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Model:** YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)
* **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy
* **Documentation:** Included in the repository as `SIH Presentation.pdf`

## Key Features
* **Real-Time Detection:** Provides instant feedback on hand gestures via webcam.
* **Custom Dataset:** Trained on a specialized dataset for high accuracy in traditional dance forms.
* **Educational Tool:** Designed to assist students in practicing mudras without a physical instructor.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Hastalaya-Mudra-Recognition.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the detector: `python "surv_bot_detect (1).py" --model best.pt --source 0`
